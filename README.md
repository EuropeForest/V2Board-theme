> English [中文](https://github.com/EuropeForest/V2Board-theme/cn.md)

### About Us

We are a development team from Europe, and some development members are from Ireland, Germany, and Romania.
We undertake customization of v2board themes. We are proficient in Vue and React and can quickly create themes for you.


### Development Process
1. Contact us via [telegram](https://t.me/usapand) or [Email](mailto:EuropeForest@proton.me)

2. Please use your native language to communicate with us about your needs, such as what color scheme you need, whether there is a reference theme, etc.
3. After determining your needs, we will quote a quote and then charge a 50% deposit. When the development is completed, we will give you the remote access address and confirm the function. You confirm that there is no problem and pay the remaining balance. Then we will deliver the theme files via telegram or email.
4. If you have any questions during the use of the theme, you can contact us at any time, and we will provide you with free technical support.
